# Node-RED Nodes

A collection of my personal palette nodes (modules) for [_Node-RED_](http://nodered.org/).

## Available Nodes

- [**@danimart1991/node-red-radarr-api**](node-red-radarr-api): A set of [_Node-RED_](http://nodered.org/) nodes to use with [_Radarr API_](https://radarr.video/).

## Installation

As other custom nodes, the recommendation is to install each set of nodes using [the "_Manage Palettes_" option in _Node-RED_](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/adding-nodes).

Indeed, all of these nodes are available as individual _npm_ packages. See the list above for the _npm_ package names, or [search _npm_](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40danimart1991%2Fnode-red).

This repository acts as an overall store for these nodes - and is not intended as a way to install them - unless you really do want some development.

```bash
$ npm install @danimart1991/node-red-{node_name}
```
