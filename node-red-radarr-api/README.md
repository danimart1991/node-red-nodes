# @danimart1991/node-red-radarr-api

A set of [_Node-RED_](http://nodered.org/) nodes to use with [_Radarr API_](https://radarr.video/).

## Install

As other custom nodes, the recommendation is to install using [the "_Manage Palettes_" option in _Node-RED_](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/adding-nodes).

Indeed, these nodes are available as individual _npm_ package. This repository acts as an overall store for the nodes - and is not intended as a way to install them - unless you really do want some development.

```bash
$ npm install @danimart1991/node-red-radarr-api
```

## Usage

All the nodes have a **Server** parameter that must be configured to work (see **Config** below).

In addition, all the nodes have a **Log** output that offers information on how the execution has worked.

```jsonc
{
    "payload": {
        "source": {
            "id": "0f12103e2251c436",
            "type": "radarr-api-movie-get"
        },
        "level": "Info",
        "message": "2084 Movie/s returned"
    },
    "_msgid": "4c1261a1eb9bfb44"
}
```

| Property              | Type     | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payload.level`       | _string_ | The log **Level**: _Debug_, _Info_, _Warn_, _Error_, _Critical_ or _Other_. |
| `payload.message`     | _string_ | The log **Message**.                                                        |
| `payload.source.id`   | _string_ | The **Id** of the node that threw the log.                                  |
| `payload.source.type` | _string_ | The **Type** of the node that threw the log.                                |
| `payload.source.name` | _string_ | The **Name**, if set, of the node that threw the log.                       |

### Config

A **configuration** node that holds the credentials of a _Radarr Server_. All the nodes need this node to work.

Two parameters are required to properly configure this node:

- **URL**: It's the server's URL used to connect to _Radarr Server_, including _http(s)://_, _port_, and _urlbase_ if required.
- **API Key**: The _API Key_ generated by _Radarr Server_ under `Settings/General`.

### Get Movie/s

Get an _Array_ of all the movies stored in the _Radarr_ database. The **Id** of a movie can be included as an additional parameter to obtain only the data of that movie.

### Get Command/s

Get an _Array_ of all the commands stored in the _Radarr System Tasks Queue_. The **Id** of a command can be included as an additional parameter to obtain only the data of that command.
